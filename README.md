# Python CRN
A CRN simulator based on
[David Soloveichik's Mathematica CRN Simulator](
http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~soloveichik/crnsimulator.html)

Examples are in the `crn/examples/` folder. Install it by placing the `crn/`
folder in your python path. I'll setup an install script soon, or I'll add
it to `pip` or something idk.
